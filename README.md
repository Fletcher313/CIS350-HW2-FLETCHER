 ## Technical Background
 My programming experience involves working with Jave, Python, and C++. I am best with Java but could pick back up on any of those languages rather quickly. I have worked on a few small projects but nothing too big mostly in classes such as CIS 162 and 163. I also have some experience working with linux commands and Git.
